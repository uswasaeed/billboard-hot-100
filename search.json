While the archive was compiled through a number of methods, the original source is Billboard Magazine, owned by the Penske Media Corporation. The data dates back to the Hot 100’s beginning in August 1958 and is updated weekly, but the end date here will depend on when the user runs the code.",

    "text": "Summary\nTaylor Swift has had more solo appearances on the Billboard Hot 100 chart than any other artist, according to an analysis of chart data from Billboard Magazine. Her 1,713 solo appearances tops Morgan Wallen and Drake, though this analysis does not reflect collaborations with other artists.\nThe chart has been published weekly since August 1958, and this analysis includes data through January 27, 2026. The chart data was pulled from an archive managed by Christian McDonald, which is updated each week.\nOther findings from the data analysis include:\n\nData Takeaway: The song “Lose Control” by Teddy Swims has appeared 112 times on the Hot 100, more than any other song through January 2026. “Heat Waves” by Glass Animals has the next most appearances with 91.\nMariah Carey’s “All I Want For Christmas Is You” has spent the most time at the top of the Billboard Hot 100 through January 27, 2026 with 22 appearances.\nThe Beatles have the most No. 1 hits on the Billboard Hot 100 charts with 19, but they also have a 20th top song – “Get Back” – that is a collaboration with Billy Preston. Most other artists with double-digit top hits aren’t making new music, with the exception of Mariah Carey and Taylor Swift.\nTaylor Swift not only has the most appearances of all time in the Hot 100, she also has the most No. 1 hits in the past five years with seven.\nTaylor Swift has the most Top 10 hits overall on the Billboard Hot 100, with 61 songs reaching positions 1 through 10. Her total is significantly higher than most other performers, with Madonna coming second with 36 songs.\nBTS’ chart presence on the Billboard Hot 100 is led by “Dynamite,” which appears 32 times, and “Butter,” which follows with 20 appearances.",
